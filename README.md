## 🧠 About the Project

**QA Thinking Engine** solves the "blank page" problem in software testing. It combines the power of **OpenAI (GPT-4)** with structured QA engineering principles.

Instead of hours spent on manual writing, simply input a **test intent**, and the application acts as a senior architect to generate a complete strategy: from acceptance criteria and edge cases to production-ready automation code.

---

## ⚡ Why This Matters?

Business and development teams often struggle with the "QA bottleneck." Here is how **QA Thinking Engine** compares to the traditional approach:

| Feature | Traditional QA Design | **QA Engine** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Design Time** | 2-4 Hours / Sprint | **< 1 Minute** |
| **Risk Identification** | Subjective / Human Error | **Objective / AI-Powered** |
| **Code Output** | Manual implementation | **Instant Playwright Skeleton** |
| **Jira Sync** | Manual ticket creation | **Automatic REST API Export** |

## 🛡️ Security-First Approach: Expert QA Insight

Unlike standard LLM prompts, this engine is instructed to look for **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities. It specifically flags critical risks to ensure quality from the very first draft:

* **Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies missing validation for SQL Injection, XSS, and Broken Authentication in every test scenario.
* **Strategic Rationale:** Every test is generated with a business context, explaining *why* the test is critical for the product's stability.
* **AI Guardrails:** Uses **Advanced Prompt Chaining** to separate logical analysis from code generation, ensuring high accuracy and preventing AI hallucinations.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The application follows a clean separation of concerns, ensuring modularity between the UI, the logical engine, and the AI integration.

## 📸 Application Preview

### 1. 📊 QA Dashboard
*Real-time overview of test coverage, automation status, and recent execution metrics. The dashboard serves as the command center for all QA activities.*
![Dashboard View](./docs/Dashboard.png)

### 2. 🎬 Workflow: Intent to Structure
*Live demonstration of entering a test intent. The engine interprets natural language (Czech) and immediately suggests a test structure.*
![Input Workflow](./docs/TC1.gif)

### 3. 🧠 AI Analysis & Processing
*Visual feedback while the specialized AI agent analyzes the intent, constructs logic, and identifies potential risks.*
![AI Processing](./docs/Loading1.gif)

### 4. 📋 Deep Dive: Test Case Detail
*The final output: A structured Acceptance test with distinct steps, preconditions, and a dedicated "Expert QA Insight" panel.*
![Detail View](./docs/TCD01.png)

### 5. 🛠️ Automated Playwright Code
*One-click generation of production-ready Playwright (TypeScript) code skeletons, fully commented and typed.*
![Code Generation](./docs/Skeleton.png)

### 6. 🎫 JIRA Integration (Proof of Concept)
*Direct integration with Atlassian JIRA. Scenarios can be exported as Tasks/Epics via REST API, bridging the gap between design and management.*

## 📦 Output Structure

Unlike generic chat bots, this engine enforces **strict structured outputs** suitable for professional QA workflows.

### 1️⃣ Test Scenarios (The "What" & "Why")
Defines the scope and business goal before jumping into steps.

```json
{
  "id": "SC-01",
  "title": "User Login Validation",
  "goal": "Verify that a registered user can access the account with valid credentials.",
  "risk": "Unauthorized access potential if validation fails."
}
```

### 2️⃣ Test Cases (The "How")
Generates actionable steps for manual or automated execution.

```json
{
  "id": "TC-01",
  "scenarioId": "SC-01",
  "steps": [
    "Navigate to /login page",
    "Enter valid email: user@test.com",
    "Enter valid password",
    "Click 'Login' button"
  ],
  "expectedResult": "User is redirected to Dashboard"
}
```

### 3️⃣ Expert QA Insight
The engine acts as a "second pair of eyes," analyzing coverage and risks.

* **🎯 Strategic Rationale:** Explains the business context and why this specific test is critical for the product.
* **📊 Coverage:** Validates if the test covers "Acceptance flows" or "Negative scenarios".
* **🛡️ Risks:** Identifies edge cases (e.g., SQL Injection, Brute Force).
* **🤖 Automation Tips:** Suggests locators (e.g., `data-testid`) for stability.

---

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

* 🚀 **Accelerates Test Design:** Reduces planning time by ~80%. Instantly creates comprehensive test plans from a single sentence.
* ⚖️ **Uncovers Hidden Risks:** Identifies edge cases and security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection) that humans might overlook.
* 🤖 **Instant Automation:** Immediately converts textual test steps into syntactically correct **Playwright (TypeScript)** code.
* 🇨🇿 **Localized Output:** The engine is **optimized for Czech language output** by default (configurable via prompt settings), ensuring consistent documentation.
* 🛡️ **AI Guardrails:** Implements heuristic validators to minimize hallucinations and ensure the generated steps are logically sequential.
* 🎫 **Seamless JIRA Integration:** (Experimental) Prototype feature for exporting scenarios directly to JIRA as Epics/Tasks.
