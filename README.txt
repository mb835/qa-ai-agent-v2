> **AI-assisted tool for QA test design, bridging the gap between vague intent and structured automation.**

The **QA Thinking Engine** acts as a senior QA architect. It interprets natural language intents and transforms them into structured test scenarios, comprehensive test cases, risk analysis, and executable Playwright code skeletons.


---

## ⚡ Why This Matters?

Business and development teams often struggle with the "QA bottleneck." Here is how **QA Thinking Engine** compares to the traditional approach:

| Feature | Traditional QA Design | **QA Thinking Engine** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Design Time** | 2–4 Hours / Sprint | **< 1 Minute** |
| **Risk Identification** | Subjective / Human Error | **Objective / AI-Powered Insight** |
| **Code Output** | Manual implementation | **Instant Playwright Skeleton** |
| **Jira Sync** | Manual ticket creation | **Automatic REST API Export** |

## 🛡️ Security-First Approach: Expert QA Insight

Unlike standard LLM prompts, this engine is instructed to look for **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities. It specifically flags critical risks to ensure quality from the very first draft:

* **Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies missing validation for SQL Injection, XSS, and Broken Authentication in every test scenario.
* **Strategic Rationale:** Every test is generated with a business context, explaining *why* the test is critical for the product's stability.
* **AI Guardrails:** Uses **Advanced Prompt Chaining** to separate logical analysis from code generation, ensuring high accuracy and preventing AI hallucinations.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

The application follows a clean separation of concerns, ensuring modularity between the UI, the logical engine, and the AI integration.

## 📦 Core Capabilities & Output Structure

Unlike generic chat bots, this engine enforces **strict structured outputs** suitable for professional QA workflows.

### 1️⃣ Test Scenarios (The "What" & "Why")
Defines the scope and business goal before jumping into steps.

```json
{
  "id": "SC-01",
  "title": "User Login Validation",
  "goal": "Verify that a registered user can access the account with valid credentials.",
  "risk": "Unauthorized access potential if validation fails."
}
```

### 2️⃣ Test Cases (The "How")
Generates actionable steps for manual or automated execution.

```json
{
  "id": "TC-01",
  "scenarioId": "SC-01",
  "steps": [
    "Navigate to /login page",
    "Enter valid email: user@test.com",
    "Enter valid password",
    "Click 'Login' button"
  ],
  "expectedResult": "User is redirected to Dashboard"
}
```

### 3️⃣ Expert QA Insight
The engine acts as a "second pair of eyes," analyzing coverage and risks.

* **🛡️ Risks:** Identifies edge cases (e.g., SQL Injection, Brute Force).
* **📊 Coverage:** Validates if the test covers the "Happy Path" or "Negative flows".
* **🤖 Automation Tips:** Suggests locators (e.g., `data-testid`) for stability.

---

## ✨ Key Features & Philosophy

* **🤖 AI Test Strategy Generator:** Instantly creates comprehensive test plans from a single sentence.
* **🇨🇿 Localized Output:** The engine is **optimized for Czech language output** by default (configurable via prompt settings), ensuring consistent documentation for local teams.
* **🛡️ AI Guardrails:** Implements heuristic validators to minimize hallucinations and ensure the generated steps are logically sequential.
* **⚖️ Risk-Based Approach:** Every test case includes a risk assessment to prioritize critical flows.
* **🎭 Auto-Playwright:** Converts textual test steps into syntactically correct **Playwright (TypeScript)** code.
* **🎫 JIRA Integration (Experimental):** Prototype feature for exporting scenarios directly to JIRA as Epics/Tasks.
